# Art to GIF

Protect your artwork on Twitter/X by automatically converting images to GIF or Video format. Both formats help protect your art from unauthorized AI modifications while offering different advantages based on your needs.

## Why Art to GIF?

AI editing tools on Twitter/X can't process GIF or video files, making them an effective way to protect your artwork from unauthorized modifications. This extension seamlessly converts your static images into protected formats while maintaining quality.

## Features

- **One-Click Conversion**: Convert images to GIF or Video format with a single click
- **Multiple Format Options**: Choose between GIF (15MB limit) or Video (512MB limit)
- **High Quality**: Maintains original image quality with smart compression
- **Seamless Integration**: Works directly within Twitter/X's post composer
- **Easy to Use**: No complex settings or configuration required
- **Privacy-First**: All conversions happen locally in your browser

## Installation

The extension is available for multiple browsers:

- **Chrome Web Store** - <https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/art-to-gif/ieaaafobhbfkdamlidcookclikabngok>
- **Microsoft Edge Add-ons** - <https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/art-to-gif/mhkdchgbgfefbcgajfihdonajafhckan>
- **Firefox Add-ons** - Coming soon
- **Safari Extensions** - Coming soon

## How to Use

1. Install the extension in your browser
2. Go to Twitter/X (x.com)
3. When creating a post, look for the conversion button next to the image upload button
4. Click the conversion button and select your artwork image (PNG/JPG)
5. The extension will automatically convert it to your chosen format (GIF or Video)
6. Post as usual - your art is now protected from AI editing tools!

The conversion happens seamlessly in the background, creating a short loop from your static image.

## Format Options

You can choose between two conversion formats in the extension settings:

### GIF Format

- **File size limit**: 15 MB
- **Color depth**: 256 colors maximum
- **Resolution**: Maximum 2048x2048
- **Best for**: Wide compatibility, smaller images

### Video Format (MP4/WebM)

- **File size limit**: 512 MB
- **Color depth**: Millions of colors
- **Compression**: Better compression efficiency
- **Best for**: Higher quality, larger images, better compression

## Why Video Instead of GIF?

- **Better file size limits**: Twitter allows up to 512MB for videos vs 15MB for GIFs
- **Smaller file sizes**: Modern video codecs compress much better than GIF
- **Better quality**: Videos support millions of colors instead of GIF's 256 color limit
- **Same protection**: AI editing tools still can't process video files

## Privacy

Art to GIF processes all conversions locally in your browser. No images are uploaded to external servers, ensuring your artwork remains private and secure.
