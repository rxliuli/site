  - Correctly handles IndexedDB-supported types like `Date`, `Blob`, `File`, `ArrayBuffer` (serialization & deserialization).

## 🚀 Why IDBPort?

Many existing IndexedDB tools only offer export functionality, making data migration, backup recovery, or syncing data across different environments incomplete. IDBPort aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive export _and_ import solution, empowering developers and power users to fully manage their local web application data.
