## Features

- 🔄 **Automatic URL Rewriting**: Monitors clipboard and rewrites URLs based on matching rules
- 📋 **Rule Management**: Visual interface for managing redirect rules
- 🌐 **Built-in Shared Rules**: 1000+ pre-configured rules for cleaning tracking parameters and unwrapping redirects from popular sites (Google, Amazon, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
- 🧪 **Rule Testing**: Test rule before applying
- 🔔 **System Notifications**: Notifies when URLs are rewritten
- 🌓 **Dark Mode**: System dark mode support

## How It Works

1. The application monitors the system clipboard in the background
2. When a URL is detected, it checks against enabled rules in order
3. If a match is found, the clipboard content is automatically rewritten
4. A system notification is sent to inform the user of the redirect

## Quick Start

### Development Mode

```bash
# Start full application (backend + frontend)
task dev

# Frontend only (browser debugging)
cd frontend
pnpm dev
```

### Build

```bash
# Build application
task build

# Build frontend only
cd frontend
pnpm build
```

## Usage Examples

### Built-in Shared Rules

LinkPure comes with 1000+ pre-configured rules that automatically:

#### Clean Tracking Parameters

- Remove `utm_*`, `fbclid`, `gclid`, and other tracking parameters
- Clean Amazon affiliate tags and tracking IDs
- Strip YouTube tracking parameters (`feature`, `si`, etc.)
- Remove social media tracking codes

#### Unwrap Redirects

- Extract actual URLs from Google redirect links (`/url?q=...`)
- Unwrap Facebook link shim (`l.facebook.com/l.php`)
- Decode Reddit outbound links
- Remove tracking from email links

These rules are embedded in the application and work out of the box. No configuration needed!

### Custom Rule Configuration

You can also create your own rules using regular expressions:

**Example 1: Redirect Google Search to DuckDuckGo**

- From: `^https://www\.google\.com/search\?q=(.*)$`
- To: `https://duckduckgo.com/?q=$1`

**Example 2: Convert YouTube Shorts to Regular Videos**

- From: `https://www\.youtube\.com/shorts/([\w-]+)`
- To: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=$1`

**Example 3: Simplify Reddit Notification Links**

- From: `https://www\.reddit\.com/r/(.*?)/comments/(.*?)\?.*&ref_source=email`
- To: `https://www.reddit.com/r/$1/comments/$2`

### Interface Operations

1. **Add Rule**: Click the "Add Rule" button
2. **Edit Rule**: Click the edit icon on the rule card
3. **Enable/Disable**: Use the toggle switch to change rule status
4. **Test Rules**: Click "Test Rules" and enter a URL to see redirect results
5. **Delete Rule**: Click the delete icon to remove a rule

### Updating Shared Rules

To update the built-in shared rules from external sources:

```bash
# Update all rules
npm run update-rules

# Or step by step
npm run download-rules  # Download latest rules from ClearURLs and Linkumori
npm run merge-sources   # Merge with custom rules
```

The shared rules are sourced from:

- [ClearURLs](https://github.com/ClearURLs/Addon): Comprehensive tracking parameter database
- [Linkumori](https://github.com/Linkumori/Linkumori-Extension): Community-maintained URL parameter removal rules
- [Custom Rules](./internal/rules/sources/custom-rules.json): Manually maintained rules
