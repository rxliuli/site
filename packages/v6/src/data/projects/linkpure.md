## How It Works

1. The application monitors the system clipboard in the background
2. When a URL is detected, it checks against enabled rules in order
3. If a match is found, the clipboard content is automatically rewritten
4. A system notification is sent to inform the user of the redirect

## Built-in Shared Rules

LinkPure comes with 1000+ pre-configured rules that work out of the box. No configuration needed!

### Clean Tracking Parameters

Automatically remove common tracking parameters:

- `utm_*`, `fbclid`, `gclid` and other marketing tracking codes
- Amazon affiliate tags and tracking IDs
- YouTube tracking parameters (`feature`, `si`, etc.)
- Social media tracking codes

### Unwrap Redirects

Extract actual URLs from redirect wrappers:

- Google redirect links (`/url?q=...`)
- Facebook link shim (`l.facebook.com/l.php`)
- Reddit outbound links
- Email tracking links

## Custom Rules

Create your own URL rewriting rules using regular expressions.
