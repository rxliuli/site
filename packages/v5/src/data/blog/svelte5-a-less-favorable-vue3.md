## Background

Svelte5 was released in October last year, touted as the best version of Svelte to date. The team was particularly proud of "runes," a reactive state system built on proxies. However, after experiencing Vue3's Composition API and SolidJS signals, I didn't feel particularly excited. This blog outlines specific issues encountered when using Svelte5 in real projects. If you're a Svelte5 enthusiast, you might want to stop reading now.

## Runes Only Work in Svelte Components or .svelte.ts Files

When trying to write hooks with runes similar to React/Vue, like `useCounter`:

```ts
export function useCounter() {
  let count = $state(0)
  return {
    get value() {
      return count
    },
    inc() {
      count++
    },
    dec() {
      count--
    },
  }
}

const counter = useCounter()
console.log(counter.value)
counter.inc()
```

This function cannot be placed in regular .ts files. It must use the .svelte.ts extension and be compiled by @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte, otherwise you'll get `$state is not defined`. This also applies to unit tests - if you want to use runes (typically for testing hooks/Svelte components), the filename must end with .svelte.test.ts. This creates unpleasant code infection.

> [Source documentation](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/what-are-runes#:~:text=Runes%20are%20symbols%20that%20you%20use%20in%20.svelte%20and%20.svelte.js%20/%20.svelte.ts%20files%20to%20control%20the%20Svelte%20compiler)

## Hooks Using Runes Must Wrap State in Functions

Notice how the returned value in useCounter is wrapped in a getter? This is mandatory. If you try to write a hook that directly returns rune states (whether $state or $derived), they must be wrapped in functions to "maintain reactivity," otherwise you'll get an error pointing to [this documentation](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/compiler-warnings#state_referenced_locally). This also applies to function parameters:

```ts
import { onMount } from 'svelte'

export function useTime() {
  let now = $state(new Date())
  onMount(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      now = new Date()
    }, 1000)
    return () => clearInterval(interval)
  })
  return now
}
```

You can't simply return `{ now }` but must use getters/setters, forcing more boilerplate:

```ts
export function useTime() {
  // other code...
  return {
    get now() {
      return now
    },
    set now(value) {
      now = value
    },
  }
}
```

## Classes as First-Class Citizens for Runes... or Not?

When I mentioned wrapping runes states in functions, the Svelte team left themselves an escape hatch: classes. The following code works by directly returning a class instance! If you check SvelteKit's official code, they even combine class declaration and creation: [SvelteKit example](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/3bab7e3eea4dda6ec485d671803709b70852f28b/packages/kit/src/runtime/client/state.svelte.js#L31-L40)

```ts
export function useClazz1() {
  class Clazz1 {
    count = $state(0)
    inc() {
      this.count++
    }
    dec() {
      this.count--
    }
  }
  return new Clazz1()
}
```

However, this doesn't work with plain JavaScript objects - it fails at compile time:

```ts
export function usePojo() {
  return {
    value: $state(0), // `$state(...)` can only be used as a variable declaration initializer or a class field https://svelte.dev/e/state_invalid_placement
    inc() {
      this.value++
    },
    dec() {
      this.value--
    },
  }
}
```

Can $state make an entire class reactive?

```ts
class Clazz2 {
  value = 0
  inc() {
    this.value++
  }
  dec() {
    this.value--
  }
}
const clazz = $state(new Clazz2())
```

Of course not. Making class fields reactive like MobX seems too difficult. Interestingly, you can use plain JS objects here:

```ts
const clazz = $state({
  value: 0,
  inc() {
    this.value++
  },
  dec() {
    this.value--
  },
})
```

> All these patterns work fine in Vue3, which has fewer quirks.

## Svelte Templates Include Features That Cannot Be Implemented in JavaScript

As documented, you cannot use bindable props in tests because they're template-specific features with no JavaScript equivalent. You must create additional components to convert bindable props to Svelte/store writable props for testing:

```svelte
<!-- input.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
  let {
    value = $bindable(),
  }: {
    value?: string
  } = $props()
</script>

<input bind:value />
```

When testing this component with bindable props, you must write a wrapper:

```svelte
<!-- Input.test.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
  import { type Writable } from 'svelte/store'

  let {
    value,
  }: {
    value?: Writable<string>
  } = $props()
</script>

<input bind:value={$value} />
```

Unit test:

```ts
import { expect, it } from 'vitest'
import { render } from 'vitest-browser-svelte'
import InputTest from './Input.test.svelte'
import { get, writable } from 'svelte/store'
import { tick } from 'svelte'

it('Input', async () => {
  let value = writable('')
  const screen = render(InputTest, { value })
  expect(get(value)).empty
  const inputEl = screen.baseElement.querySelector('input') as HTMLInputElement
  inputEl.value = 'test1'
  inputEl.dispatchEvent(new InputEvent('input'))
  expect(get(value)).eq('test1')
  value.set('test2')
  await tick()
  expect(inputEl.value).eq('test2')
})
```

Is there a way to dynamically bind multiple bindable props like in Vue3?

```html
<template>
  <my-component v-bind="dynamicProps"></my-component>
</template>

<script setup>
  import { reactive } from 'vue'

  const dynamicProps = reactive({
    title: 'Title',
    description: 'Desc',
    active: true,
  })
</script>
```

No, there isn't even an escape hatch, so you can't create a generic Bindable2Writable higher-order component to automatically convert bindable props to writable props. This is particularly frustrating considering how well Vue3 handles this.

## Form Components Are Uncontrolled by Default, Which Can Cause Issues

For a simple component with a two-way bound checkbox:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  let checked = $state(false)
</script>

<input type="checkbox" bind:checked />
```

What happens if you remove the bind? One-way binding? No, it only sets the initial value, then the input's internal state takes over, contrary to expectations. [See 3-second demo](https://x.com/rxliuli/status/1896856626050855298/video/3)

This isn't unique to Svelte - except for React, most web frameworks make exceptions to unidirectional data flow for forms.

## Small Ecosystem

This affects all new frameworks, but is particularly severe with Svelte:

- Router: Couldn't find a memory SPA router compatible with Svelte5 in early January [Issue](https://github.com/ItalyPaleAle/svelte-spa-router/issues/318)
- Query: TanStack Query supports Svelte, but Svelte5 support remains unreleased [Discussion](https://github.com/TanStack/query/discussions/7413)
- shadcn/ui: The Svelte implementation has poor Shadow DOM support [Issue](https://github.com/huntabyte/bits-ui/issues/828)
- Table/Form: Couldn't find suitable components for these complex UI elements; TanStack Table's API is problematic
- Virtual List: Couldn't find libraries supporting variable row height/column width for lists/grids
- Chart: Integrated ECharts manually and contributed a PR for Svelte5 support, but it remains unreleased [PR](https://github.com/bherbruck/svelte-echarts/pull/34)

## Community Response

When people complain about Svelte5's increased complexity, community members often dismiss them as newcomers struggling with "hello world" or suggest sticking with Svelte4. First, I've used React/Vue before and built substantial applications with Svelte4 (10k+ lines of pure code). Second, sticking with older versions is impractical for new projects when the ecosystem is rapidly moving forward, making resources for older versions hard to find.

Right after I published this blog, someone immediately defended with "Svelte's reactivity doesn't exist at runtime," which isn't even a valid argument in svelte5. Of course, he received 5 üëç, while I got one üëé.
<https://www.reddit.com/r/sveltejs/comments/1j6ayaf/comment/mgnctgm/>

## Conclusion

Has Svelte5 improved? Runes make it somewhat more similar to React/Vue, but there are still many edge cases and quirks. For my next project, I might seriously consider SolidJS. After using React/Vue for so long, I'm still interested in exploring new alternatives.
