## üöÄ Why IDBPort?

Many existing IndexedDB tools only offer export functionality, making data migration, backup recovery, or syncing data across different environments incomplete. IDBPort aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive export _and_ import solution, empowering developers and power users to fully manage their local web application data.
